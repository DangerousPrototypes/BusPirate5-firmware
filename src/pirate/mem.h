 * @brief		Header file of the memory management module
 *
 * A simple module to manage allocation of a single nand page buffer.
 *
 * This was made in response to many modules (shell_command, spi_nand),
 * needing temporary access to a page-sized array, and not wanting to
 * create that array on the stack or allocate it statically for the lifetime
 * of the application. This is not the page buffer used by the flash translation
 * layer.
