; 1-Wire is a tradmark of Maxim Integrated
;
; Do 1-Wire operation on RP2040 PIO:
;  - Receive/Transmit 1 to max. 128 bits w.o. ARM activity
;    (by using FIFO and controlling RX/TX FIFO threshold setting)
;  - perform reset and presence detect
;  - control external strong pullp P-channel MOSFET
;    (as e.g. in the DS2482-100)
;  - Requires 11 PIO instructions

.program onewire
.side_set 1 pindirs

; Some Notes:
;
; I would have liked to use GPIO_OVERRIDE_INVERT for easier
; readablility of the code, but with this I wasn't able to avoid a
; glitch on the 1-Wire GPIO pin when the state machine was
; configured/enabled. Hence side set 0 disables the output (high level
; signal by ext. pullup).
;
; The is no difference in writing a 1 or reading a bit. Both
; will be triggered by a 1 bit in the TX FIFO and both return a
; bit to the RX FIFO.
; Even writing a 0 will return data in the TX FIFO (undefined bit).
; This is useless on the one hand, but is done to make bit positions
; easier predicable if reading and writing is combined and to detect
; end of write operation easily by checking RX FIFO state.  Shift
; threshold has to be controlled by the ARM to transfer the desired
; number of bits.
;
; ARM can check for the end of an operation by checking the RX FIFO for
; availablibilty of data (data transfer or reset).
; HOWEVER at the time when the data is pushed into the RX FIFO, the
; execution of the bit timing has not been fully completed. This is no
; problem if you just want to transmit more bits by pushing new data
; to the TX FIFO. However, at that time it is not yet possible to:
;    - change settings (clock-devider or FIFO thresholds)
;    - trigger a 1-Wire reset
; If you desire to do such things, you have to check that
; the state machine has reached the 'waiting' label by polling
; the PIO program counter.
;   POSSIBLE TODO:
;   This is clumsy, but can only be changed by increasing PIO code
;   size (Probably three instructions):
;     - first moving pins to x at the sample point
;     - then finish bit timing (maybe wrapped into the previous)
;     - then push x to the RX FIFO
;     - needed for rx-, tx- and reset-branch
;   This will also impact performance as the change would introduce a
;   6us gap between all bits.
;   However that change might be desireable if you wish an interrupt
;   driven ARM code w.o. any ARM time wasted by polling.
