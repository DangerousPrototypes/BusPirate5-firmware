### License Compliance explained
First of all, we give the copyright notices in all the respective places in this repo.
Secondly, this project is completely open source and published to the public, and distributed binaries are delivered with a link to this repo.
Thirdly, the original libraries code is left unmodified, and their code gets fetched by the build system, therefore that code is not part of this project.

Therefore, we comply with all the terms of the LGPL3 license, including section 4.d.0, because by access to this source code, the user can easily use the build system in order to provide a different library that has the same interface.

In conclusion, these are the reasons that we comply with LGPL3 and we can distribute binaries under LGPL3 terms.  
For further information, please see the discussion at [github](https://github.com/DangerousPrototypes/BusPirate5-firmware/pull/34).

## BSD 3 Clause
This license is completely compatible with our MIT license. So BSD components have been directly incorporated into this project.
