Bus Pirate 7 is the latest edition of the universal serial interface trusted by hackers since 2008.

Can't get a chip to work? Is it the circuit, code, bad part or a burned out pin? The Bus Pirate sends commands over common serial protocols (1-Wire, I2C, SPI, UART, MIDI, serial LEDs, etc) so you can get to know a chip before prototyping. Updated with tons of new features, talking to chips and probing interfaces is more fun than ever!
